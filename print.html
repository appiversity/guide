<p>Your account always has an <em>active academic year</em>, and other inactive years.</p>
<p>Within appiversity, you manage lots of data - and almost all of it is tied to specific academic years.  This is pretty intuitive when you think about course catalog information - courses, degrees, requirements.  Clearly, in order to manage the catalog you need the concept of <em>current academic year</em>, and you also need to be able to retain copies of all the data from <em>previous academic years</em>.  Moreover, it’s likely that throughout the year you will work on updating data for <em>future academic years</em>.  The catalog systems must have a way to manage multiple years of data.</p>
<p>appiversity Catalog of course does this, and allows you to <a href="academic-years/./rollover.html">rollover</a> one AY to another.  It also uses <a href="academic-years/./stems.html">stems</a> - a concept of <em>linking</em> things across years.  This way, there is a built in connection between a the 2024 version of “Intro to Pottery” and the 2025 version - the system understand they are the <em>same course</em>, but with potentially <em>different</em> details - based on the AY.</p>
<p><strong>Critically</strong>, appiversity doesn’t use academic years, rollover, and stemming <strong>just for catalog data</strong> - these concepts are part of nearly everything.  Faculty and Staff data (and public profiles) can be versioned by year.  Same with departments, and the people and the positions they fill within them.  Workflow (approval forms) are tied to years, so you can change them over time and not lose track of old ones.  Schedule builder uses different listings of timeblocks, classrooms, course and section attributes based on which year you are building.  appiversity allows you to manage all of your academic data <em>versioned</em> by academic year.</p>

</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="active-academic-year"><a class="header" href="#active-academic-year">Active Academic Year</a></h1>
<p>Your account always has an <em>active academic year</em>.  This is a global configuration across the entire application, and it is important that you understand how it relates to various features.</p>
<h2 id="setting-the-active-academic-year"><a class="header" href="#setting-the-active-academic-year">Setting the Active Academic Year</a></h2>
<p>The academic year is accessible from the AY page - which is linked from the home screen.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/ay-page.png'/>
<p>In order to access the Academic Years page, you need the <strong>rollover</strong> <a href="academic-years/../users/privileges.html">privilege</a>.  This privilege allows you to change the academic year and rollover data from one year to another.  You should allow a limited set of people to have this privilege, as they can make application-wide changes that can affect <em>public</em> facing content as well as internal.  Although most actions are reversible, your institution will want to coordinate the timing of changing academic years and performing rollovers.</p>
<p>Form the academic year page, you can change the current year by entering it into the input box as shown.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/ay-active-year.png'/>
<p>This action is completely reversible and non-destructive.</p>
<h2 id="viewing-active-and-other-years"><a class="header" href="#viewing-active-and-other-years">Viewing active and other years</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you are using appiversity, you are <em>implicitly</em> viewing (and editing) data associated with a <em>current year</em>.  It’s always clear which year you are working with - it’s at the top right of your screen.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/ay-viewing-year.png'/>
<p>At any time, you can change the year you are viewing, by changing the value and clicking the → button.</p>
<p>It’s usually pretty important to know that you are viewing a year that is <strong>not the current AY</strong>.  It’s always clear when this is the case, it’s shown at the top of the screen.  You can click the text to switch into the current year at any time.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/ay-inactive.png'/>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - When you change the AY you are viewing while you are viewing a page tied to an AY, appiversity will do it’s best to help you navigate.  For example, if you are viewing a course in the 2025 catalog, and change the year to 2026, if the course you are viewing exists in the 2026 catalog appiversity will automatically switch you to the 2026 version.  If the course doesn’t exist in 2026, you will be shown a list of years the course <em>does</em> exist in.</p>
<p>Below, we are looking at a course in the 2024 catalog.<br />
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/course-active.png'/></p>
<p>When we change the AY to 2023, we see that the course actually isn’t present in the 2023 catalog.  We’re shown a list of years to choose from instead.<br />
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/course-inactive.png'/></p>
<p>If the course <em>had</em> existed in 2023, we would have been brought directly to that version.</p>
<p>All of this is accomplished through <a href="academic-years/./stems.html">stemming</a>, and for the most part it “just works” - you won’t need to think about it as long as you are using <a href="academic-years/./rollover.html">rollover</a> to create each year.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions-to-ay-data"><a class="header" href="#exceptions-to-ay-data">Exceptions to AY data</a></h3>
<p>There are some exceptions to the rule that everything is tied to academic years.  Anything found in <strong>Settings &amp; defaults</strong> is <em>global</em>.  This includes things like label preferences, and application configuration.  The settings in this area aren’t date based, and wouldn’t make sense to behave one way for one year, and another way for another.</p>
<p>Another exception is <strong><a href="academic-years/../users/accounts.html">Users</a></strong>.  Users are people who <em>create, edit, and manage</em> the data of the institution.  They have full accounts on appiversity, with a set of privileges to control who can change what.  <strong>These accounts are not AY-based</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> - there’s a big difference between <strong>users</strong> and <strong>People</strong>.  <strong><a href="academic-years/../departments/people-public-people-users.html">People</a></strong> are the people who work at your institution - faculty, staff, etc.  They will use appiversity too - but they use it very differently.  Moreover, <em>they are data</em>, too.  Faculty profiles, and the departments they reside in - for example - <strong>is academic data</strong>, and is tied to academic years.  <strong>People</strong> are tied to AY (they are rolled over, and stemmed), <strong>Users</strong> are not.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-changing-ays"><a class="header" href="#impact-of-changing-ays">Impact of changing AYs</a></h2>
<p>Data for the active year, and for any year after the active year, is considered editable. Data for years before the active year is considered archived. That said, <strong>in most cases</strong>, archived (past) year’s data is still editable, but it is discouraged. In some situation, archived data is locked - such as public profiles of faculty from past years.</p>
<p>Below are some other implications of changing the AY.</p>
<h3 id="workflows"><a class="header" href="#workflows">Workflows</a></h3>
<p>Workflows are tied to academic years, like most things in appiversity.  They can be <a href="academic-years/./rollover.html">rolled</a> to other academic years, and they are <a href="academic-years/./stems.html">stemmed</a>.</p>
<p>Workflows are frequently published via links, and emailed.  It’s common for people to bookmark them as well.  It is common for people to attempt to access (initiate) workflows from previous academic years, because the links are unique for each year.  When this happens,  the user will be prevented from submitting the workflow, and will be advised to visit the workflow found in the <em>current academic year</em>.  They will also be advised to change the bookmark they are using.</p>
<p>Note, workflows <em>submitted</em> in other academic years are always accessible, and can continue to be worked on.  For example, consider the following situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A faculty member submits a travel request in June 2025, which is part of your institution’s AY 2025.  The workflow is assigned a tracking ID, and the faculty member is emailed a link to view it’s progress.</li>
<li>The approver (maybe the Dean) is of course away on vacation, and doesn’t take a look at the workflow until mid-July 2025.  July 1 is your institution pivot date, and you have changed the current AY to 2026.</li>
<li>The workflow <strong>is still active</strong>, and the dean can still take action on it.  If approved, all is well.  If revisions are requested, the faculty member can still resubmit the changes.  <strong>The fact that the workflow is from 2025, and the current AY is 2026, is irrelevant</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above scenario is <strong>different</strong> than if in July 2025, the faculty member attempts to <em>start</em> a workflow that is from AY 2025.  In that case, they are advised that they must instead work with the AY 2026 version of the workflow (if it exists).  If it does not exist, the workflow is unable to be started.</p>

<p>Workflows can replace the paper forms, Word documents, and PDF files that you are circulating via email to drive <strong>approvals</strong> and <strong>workflow</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s the scenario to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>A student wants to drop a course.</li>
<li>The student needs to fill out a form, and get their instructor’s signature.</li>
<li>From there, they may need to have that form forwarded to the department chair or dean for another round of approval.</li>
<li>Lastly, the form is forwarded to the registrar, where the request is processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario get’s repeated within academics countless times - from student requests, faculty travel requests, course scheduling modifications, graduation applications, etc.</p>
<p>Ten or fifteen years ago, most institutions did this with <em>paper</em> forms, where each person along the approval chain needed to sign the document.  There’s a certain convenience to this - there’s just one copy of the form, and it’s easy to fill out.  It’s wasteful, and expensive though - and forms get lost.</p>
<p>Then we all started <em>digitizing</em>, and it went something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper documents were converted into PDFs, but they were really difficult to “sign”.  People printed them, filled them out, signed them, scanned them, and emailed them.  This didn’t help much!</li>
<li>PDFs were then made “fillable”, which helped, since now at least the form data didn’t need to to be handwritten anymore!</li>
<li>PDFs could be digitally signed - either by drawing a signature, attaching a photo of a drawn signature, or using a <em>digital signature</em> that needed to be created and configured on the user’s computer.  This seemed right - but of course getting the signatures to reliably work, on everyone’s computer, was a nightmare.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, we replaced wasteful paper forms with <em>thousands</em> of email attachments, IT headaches configuring digital signatures (which really aren’t necessary - these aren’t exactly legal documents!), and aggravation.</p>
<p>After all that, those digital documents remain in <em>everyone’s</em> email archives - there’s no repository for them.  There’s no <strong>real</strong> paper trail at all!</p>
<p>Some institutions, recognizing the inefficiencies, adopted tools from the legal and real estate industry, which managed the digital signing of documents across approval chains without installation and email forwarding - <em>but they are expensive</em>.</p>
<p><span style='color:OrangeRed'>Workflows </span> offers an alternative.  With workflows, you can easily create your forms and publish them in a searchable listing.  Users can fill forms, and get data prepopulated - which drastically improves accuracy.  You can create approval chains, and the form is instantaneously routed to where it needs to go.  Every step along the way, there is a full audit of who’s approving, and when.  All stakeholders can see the status of the approval and workflow.  When the workflow is complete, it’s archived and searchable from one place - by everyone.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>workflows is free</em> (although long term retention is limited to paid plans).  It’s included in the <strong>Kickstart</strong> package.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>This document is an user guide for getting started with Workflows.  We’ll walk you through creating new workflows, defining approval chains, using document attachments, and managing access.  <strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>
<h1 id="whats-a-workflow"><a class="header" href="#whats-a-workflow">What’s a <em>Workflow</em>?</a></h1>
<p>When we talk about a Workflow, we are referring to the entire process associated around a particular approval or workflow sequence.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>Course Drop</strong> is a <strong>workflow</strong>.  It requires the <em>initiator</em> (presumably a student) to populate a form documenting which course they are dropping.  This information is then <em>approved</em> or rejected by a sequence of people - the instructor, the chair, the dean.  The information passed to the registrar for processing.  This entire process is a <strong>workflow</strong>, and each step is a <strong>workflow step</strong>.</p>
<p>Whe we say “Create a workflow”, we mean <em>creating the entire process sequence</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defining what data needs to be entered to initiate the workflow</li>
<li>Defining each approval step</li>
<li>Defining what each approval step may add to the flow.  For example, attaching additional documentation or data.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Creating a workflow</strong> is different than someone <em>starting</em> a workflow - or <em>initiating a course drop</em>.  Think of <strong>creating a workflow</strong> as <strong>creating</strong> the form.  You do that once (or at least once in a while).</p>
<h2 id="who-can-create-a-workflow"><a class="header" href="#who-can-create-a-workflow">Who can create a workflow</a></h2>
<p>Remember there are different <a href="workflow/./user-categories.html">categories of stakeholders</a> using appiversity at your institution.  You have <em>people</em>, who are staff members, faculty, employees.  You have students.  You have <em>public</em> people - who are not necessarily associated with the institution at all.  While these stakeholders might <em>start</em> or <em>initiate</em> a workflow, they aren’t the people who will be <strong>creating the workflow in the first place</strong>.</p>
<p>Only appiversity <strong>users</strong> with the <strong>Workflows</strong> account privilege may create, edit, delete, and rollover workflows.  You can check a user’s profile (or your own) to see if if this privilege has been granted:</p>
<img style='width:300px' src='../images/workflow-privy.png'/>
<h1 id="creating-your-first-workflow"><a class="header" href="#creating-your-first-workflow">Creating your first Workflow</a></h1>
<p>Workflows can be accessed from the institutional home page or the main toolbar.  The cog icon is a short cut to the management area of Workflows, which is where you will create new workflows from.
<img style='width:300px' src='../images/workflow-config-from-home.png'/></p>
<img style='width:300px' src='../images/workflow-from-toolbar.png'/>
<p>Once you arrive at the Workflows screen, you have three tabs at the top:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start a Workflow - this is where you can initiate a workflow that already exists.  Anyone who is in <strong>People</strong> can access this tab, and start a workflow.</li>
<li>My Workflow Queue - this is where a list of workflows already initiated by you, or that you are an approver on are listed.  Think of this as your “inbox”, and also your archive.  We’ll talk more about this later after we create a few workflows to use.</li>
<li>Manage Workflows - this is where we will visit first.  It’s where we create workflows.  <strong>Note</strong> if you do not have the Workflows privilege, you will not see this tab!</li>
</ol>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/manage-workflows.png'/>
<p><strong>Click New Workflow</strong> to create a new workflow:</p>
<h2 id="defining-workflow-data"><a class="header" href="#defining-workflow-data">Defining Workflow Data</a></h2>
<p>Workflows consist of <em>workflow data</em>, which is information about the workflow process in general. This includes it’s name, a description, and access flags.</p>
<h3 id="active--inactive"><a class="header" href="#active--inactive">Active / Inactive</a></h3>
<p>Workflows can be set to <strong>active</strong> or <strong>inactive</strong>.  Active workflows can be started, while inactive workflows cannot.  Keeping a workflow <em>inactive</em> while it is a draft, or until you want to allow access is generally a good idea.  Once a workflow is started by someone, the workflow process itself cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>Note that workflows can by <strong>rolled</strong> over from AY to AY.  You’ll notice that you are activating the new workflow for a given AY.  The workflow will rollover to future AYs (during the normal <a href="workflow/./rollover.html">rollover process</a>) with the same Active/Inactive state.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-vs-public"><a class="header" href="#restricted-vs-public">Restricted vs Public</a></h3>
<p>Workflows marked as <strong>public</strong> can be initiated by anyone. This setting makes sense when the workflow is something a student would start (an Add/Drop request for a course), or even workflows that might be initiated by completely external people (maybe an inquiry).  “Public” workflows still require the submitter/initiator to provide a verifiable email address, but they do not need to belong to the institution.</p>
<p>Workflows marked as restricted can only be initiated by an appiversity user, they need to be logged in. This includes anyone with a full <strong>User</strong> account and anyone listed in <strong>People</strong> (ex. faculty, staff).  Restricted makes sense for workflows like a special payment form, or a grade change that can only be initiated by faculty.  Restricted workflows will never be listed in <a href="workflow/./publish.html">published</a> listings, they can only be started from within appiversity itself.</p>
<p>Let’s start by creating an example for <strong>Course Drop</strong>.  We’ll give it a title and description, and mark it as <strong>active</strong> and <strong>public</strong>, since it may be initiated by a student.</p>
<p><span style="display: none">GUIDE WATCH OUT:  Students will become users eventually, so this is an area where this guide might need to be updated.  Likewise, once Catalog and Schedule integration are complete, the UX here is going to be updated.</span></p>
<p>Once you’ve filled out the necessary data, click <strong>Next</strong> to move on to <em>submission data</em>*.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/workflow-create-data.png'/>
<h2 id="defining-submission-data"><a class="header" href="#defining-submission-data">Defining Submission Data</a></h2>
<p>Submission data is the information that the form’s initiator must provide to start the workflow.  You are required to provide <em>instructions</em>, which can be as simple as “Please fill out all required data”, or can include additional contextual information.  The person <em>starting</em> this workflow will see these instructions, so consider your audience!  You will have the opportunity to provide instructions to <em>approvals</em> separately, these instructions should only be addressing what someone needs to know to <em>start</em> or <em>request</em> the workflow.</p>
<p><span style="display: none">GUIDE WATCH OUT:  This area will need to be updated when Markdown is enabled, and link to the Markdown guide.</span></p>
<p>Next, you can add <em>submission fields</em> and <em>submission documents</em>.   This is where you have the freedom to reuse as much or as little of your institution’s existing processes as you like.</p>
<h3 id="submission-document-attachments"><a class="header" href="#submission-document-attachments">Submission Document Attachments</a></h3>
<p>If you already have a PDF or Word Doc that you are happy with, any you just want to use Workflows to manage the approval process, you might want to simply adopt a single submission document here.  You can upload an empty form in this area, and each time someone wants to initiate this workflow they will be asked to download the form (they will be given a link), fill it out, and upload it.  That filled out form will be passed along and viewable to all the approvers.  By using document attachments here, Workflow is removing the need for email forwarding, email attachments, and signatures - but you are <strong>keeping</strong> the data input functionality of your existing forms.</p>
<p><strong>Note, you can define multiple submission documents</strong> that the submitter must fill out and upload for a single workflow.</p>
<h4 id="user-provided-documents"><a class="header" href="#user-provided-documents">User-provided documents</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes workflows require users to upload their own documents, and not necessarily download a document to fill out.  A good example of this might ben a faculty travel request.  The workflow may require that the faculty member (the person initiating the workflow) upload supporting documentation - perhaps proof that they are presenting at conference.  In this case, you can define a submission document attachement, but <strong>you can omit supplying a downloadable document</strong>.  When submitting the workflow, the user will asked to upload their own document.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/workflow-doc-attach.png'/>
<h3 id="submission-fields"><a class="header" href="#submission-fields">Submission Fields</a></h3>
<p>You can use submission fields to define data inputs that will be available to users directly, through the web interface.  Using submission fields is a great way to create workflows because they are the fastest way for users to enter data - no downloading, editing, and uploading.  They are also faster to approve, since the submitted data will be displayed in an easy to identify and accessible way to everyone reviewing the workflow.  Submissions fields can be of several types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text - short text input fields, like someone’s name.</li>
<li>Long Text - a longer text input where you might ask the submitter to provide a lengthy explanation or justification of the text.  This won’t permit a lot of formatting, so consider submission document attachments if you want to receive elaborate formatting here.</li>
<li>Number - numeric input field</li>
<li>Date - date input</li>
<li>Checkbox - suitable for true/false, yes know.</li>
<li>Choice - create a list of options for the user to choose from</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add any number of submission fields.  Each field will require you to define it’s name (primary label visible to the user), description (briefly explains to the submitter specific instructions about this field), and whether or not it is a <strong>required</strong> field.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-submission"><a class="header" href="#hybrid-submission">Hybrid Submission</a></h3>
<p>Of course, you can use <strong>both</strong>.  If there are some forms that you’d like to use PDFs, Word, or any other type of document for, they can be used together with any number of submission fields too.  At each step along the approval chain, all submission data fields and all documents are accessible.</p>
<p>For demonstration, let’s build the Drop Course form so it requires a user to enter their name, the course’s title, subject, course number, section number, and an indication of why they were dropping the course - a choice between “The course is not required for me”, “The course isn’t what I expected”, and “Other”.  This isn’t something you generally find on Course Drop forms, but as an example it gives us a chance to demonstrate the choice list fields.</p>
<p><span style="display: none">GUIDE WATCH OUT:  Update the data entry here for course selection when catalog integration is complete.</span></p>
<p>Adding the student’s name (you should probably ask for some other form of more specific identifying information), along with course data is best as a series of Text inputs.  Since course numbers sometimes have alphabetical values (such as 101L for 101 w/ Lab, for example), use Text instead of Number if there is <em>any</em> doubt.</p>
<p>For each, select the Text button, and fill out the necessary information. Let’s also mark each as <em>required</em>.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/workflow-submission-data.png'/>
<img style='width:300px' src='../images/workflow-submission-data-text-01.png'/>
<img style='width:300px' src='../images/workflow-submission-data-text-02.png'/>
<p>etc. etc.</p>
<p>For the choice list describing <em>why</em> the course is being dropped, the dialog box will ask you to
provide the options users can choose from.  Remember, each option must be separated by <strong>semi-colon</strong>.<br />
This does mean that an option cannot have a semi-colon within it, as that is what is used as the delimiter.</p>
<img style='width:300px' src='../images/workflow-submission-data-choice.png'/>
<h4 id="display-order"><a class="header" href="#display-order">Display Order</a></h4>
<p>When someone starts a submission for this workflow, the input fields are displayed in the same order
they are listed in on the submission building screen. You can use the up and down arrows to re-order the fields.</p>
<img style='width:300px' src='../images/workflow-submission-data-order.png'/>
<h4 id="what-about-email-address"><a class="header" href="#what-about-email-address">What about email address?</a></h4>
<p>You might be wondering why we aren’t capturing the student’s email address.  Remember that when someone starts this workflow, <em>they are required to supply an email address</em>.  If the user is logged into appiversity (they are in the Users or People groups), then this information is already known.  If they are not logged in, they will be asked to <em>verify</em> their email address - which is a simple and fast process that ensures the workflow is being started by the owner of the supplied email address.</p>
<p>The users’s email address will be available to anyone reviewing the workflow, at all times.  Therefore, you normally do not need to capture this type of data.</p>
<p>For restricted workflows - where the workflow can only be created by someone in the Users or People groups, you don’t even need to capture their name!  All identifying information about the user who is initiating a restricted workflow is automatically added to every workflow.</p>
<h2 id="defining-approval-steps"><a class="header" href="#defining-approval-steps">Defining Approval Steps</a></h2>
<p>Once you’ve completed the submission data fields (and documents, if you wish), it’s time to move on to the approval chain.  Each workflow must have at least <strong>one</strong> approval step.  In the simplest workflow, a submitter may fill out information and submit it to the sole approver - who would approve/reject/process the workflow request without any other input from others.  In other workflows, you might have a much longer sequence of steps - where multiple stakeholders must approve the request before final processing.  On each approval step, you can define <strong>additional</strong> instructions, and also ask for <strong>additional</strong> data to be added to the workflow.</p>
<p>Every approval step will allow the “approver” to (1) <strong>approve</strong> the workflow, sending it to the <em>next</em> approver, or marking it as complete, (2) <strong>reject</strong> the workflow, marking it as “rejected” and notifying the submitter, or (3) <strong>request revision</strong>, which will send the workflow back to the last person who either approved or submitted the workflow, with a reason for the request.  In all cases, the people who need to know will receive notifications via email that a workflow item is “in their queue” - whether that’s because they are the next approver, or because it’s been kicked back to them as a request for revision.</p>
<p>At all times, the <em>submitter</em> will be able to see <strong>who</strong> has the workflow.  This creates much more transparency to workflows - no more emails that go missing!</p>
<img src='../images/workflow-approval-01.png'/>
<p>In the case of our running example, let’s define a <strong>three step</strong> sequence of approval.  First, the instructor of the course approves, then the Dean, and then the Registrar.</p>
<p>Start by clicking <strong>+ New Step</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="approval-step-1---the-instructor"><a class="header" href="#approval-step-1---the-instructor">Approval Step 1 - the instructor</a></h3>
<p>Every step has a <strong>title</strong> - the <strong>Step Label</strong>.  This will be visible in several places, so try to be descriptive.  In addition, we’ll add a description/instruction - which will be visible <strong>to the approver</strong> when the workflow reaches them.</p>
<p>You will also see a similar set of input field choices as you saw when defining <em>submission data</em>.  Don’t be confused - this is not the same!  These define data fields (or documents) that you expect the <strong>approver</strong> to add to the workflow.  This data might be necessary for the <em>next approver</em>, for example.</p>
<p>In our running example, let’s ask the instructor to indicate whether or not the student has attended at all.  Maybe this would be important information for financial aid purposes.</p>
<img src='../images/workflow-approval-02.png'/>
<h4 id="selecting-the-approver"><a class="header" href="#selecting-the-approver">Selecting the Approver</a></h4>
<p>Each approval step can be <em>open ended</em>, or a list of <strong>pre-selected</strong> approvers can be identified.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No pre-selected approver</strong> - the submitter can select <strong>any</strong> recipient for the approval, from the list of <strong>People</strong> in your institution.  This is the most flexible, but also puts a lot of responsibility on the submitter to determine who their workflow needs to go to first.  You’ll want to be extremely clear in your submission instruction when using this option.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Selected by role</strong> - Choose this options when the approval should go to people who hold a particular role at the institution - like “faculty”, “Dean”, or “Registrar”.  This will often be the best choice for most institution-wide workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Selected by position</strong> - choose this option if the approval should be received by someone holding a specific position, which is a role <strong>tied</strong> to a particular department.  Check out (Roles, Positions &amp; Assignments)[./roles-positions-assignments.html] for help understanding the difference between a Position and a Role.  This is a good option when the form is specific to a certain department.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Selected by person</strong> - choose this option when the approval step should be received by a specific individual.  This is the least flexible option, as you’ll need to update the workflow if someone change’s positions or leaves the institution.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our example, we know that first approver should be an <em>instructor</em>.  We can specify this by using the <strong>Pre-Selected by role</strong> option, and adding pre-selections for both Faculty and Adjunct.  Depending on how you set up your roles, you may have different options.</p>
<p>Note, the submitter of this workflow will be able to choose anyone belonging to ANY of these roles.</p>
<img src='../images/workflow-approval-03.png'/>
<p>Click <strong>+Save New Step</strong> to continue.</p>
<img src='../images/workflow-approval-04.png'/>
<p>The approval step will be summarized in the display, and you can add a the next step by clicking <strong>+ New Step</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="approval-step-2---the-dean"><a class="header" href="#approval-step-2---the-dean">Approval Step 2 - the Dean</a></h3>
<p>For this approval step, you might not need anything else from the Dean - just an approval, rejection, or request for revision.  Approval fields and documents are optional, so you can just move right past this and onto the Pre-Selected Approvals.</p>
<p>In the example institution, there is a Dean role.  We’ll select that and move on.</p>
<img src='../images/workflow-approval-05.png'/>
<p>Click <strong>+Save New Step</strong> to continue.</p>
<h3 id="processing-step-approval-step-3---the-registrar"><a class="header" href="#processing-step-approval-step-3---the-registrar">Processing Step (Approval Step 3) - the Registrar</a></h3>
<p>The final step is the registrar’s office, which is where the request will be processed.  Once again, this step doesn’t require the Registrar to add any data, only approval/rejection/revision.</p>
<p>Click <strong>+Save New Step</strong> to continue.  Note that with all three steps entered, you can remove them by clicking the X button at the right, or re-order them using the arrows on the left.</p>
<img src='../images/workflow-approval-06.png'/>
<h2 id="completing-the-workflow"><a class="header" href="#completing-the-workflow">Completing the Workflow</a></h2>
<p>At this point, we’ve created the submission data and approval chain.  We are ready to complete, and since we’ve marked it as <strong>active</strong> it will be listed in the workflow listings.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<img src='../images/workflow-complete.png'/>
<p>Review the workflow carefully, and click <strong>Create Workflow</strong>.  Now the workflow is complete and is available for use!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>This document is a user guide for starting an existing <strong>public</strong> workflow.

<h2 id="public-listings-and-active-academic-year"><a class="header" href="#public-listings-and-active-academic-year">Public Listings and Active Academic Year</a></h2>
<p>Unlike most things in appiversity, workflows are <em>frequently</em> accessed by people who are not logged into the application.  When non-logged in people access workflows, they are typically accessing them via <a href="workflow/./publishing-workflows.html">published HTML listings pages</a>, or from links they have saved (for example, in an email).</p>
<p>Workflows can only be <strong>initiated</strong> or <strong>started</strong> if they belong to the current academic year.  Checkout the workflows section in our <a href="workflow/../academic-years/active-ay.html">active AY</a> guide for more details.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>This document is a user guide for starting an existing workflow.  It describes the sequence of steps a user will perform to start a workflow <strong>when they are already logged into appiversity</strong>.  For public workflows - to be started by students or anyone not affiliated with your institution (they do not have an appiversity account), the process will be similar, but you should review the <a href="workflow/./public-workflows.html">public workflows guide</a> too.</p>
<h1 id="finding-a-workflow"><a class="header" href="#finding-a-workflow">Finding a Workflow</a></h1>
<p>All active workflows, whether they are public or restricted, are found in the Start a Workflow tab in the workflow page within appiversity.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/workflow-start.png'/>
<p>You may search among workflows in the search bar provided.  To start a new workflow, find the one you are looking for and <strong>click Begin</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="submission-input"><a class="header" href="#submission-input">Submission Input</a></h1>
<p>After clicking begin, a new <strong>workflow instance</strong> will be created and you will be redirected to begin submitting it.  A few details to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The link at the top of your browser will appear differently.  For example, the URL for the screenshot below is http://appiversity.com/flow/fc71721e-6cea-475e-b219-ad2ff34dd1d6.  (Don’t try it, it’s not active anymore :).  This is a <em>permalink</em> to the specific instance of your workflow that you are filling out.</li>
<li>The interface we’ll walk though now will look the same whether you are logged into appiversity with a <strong>People</strong> account (you are faculty, staff, etc), a students, or a non-affiliated <em>public person</em>.  You’ll get to this screen differently if you are a student or a non-affiliated person, and that’s described <a href="workflow/./public-workflows.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/workflow-starting.png'/>
<p>Take note that the front matter of the workflow always displays the <strong>submitter</strong>, along with the timestamp the workflow was started.  This is displayed on the top left.  The workflow <strong>status</strong> is also always displayed, at the top-right.  When you begin, the workflow is in the <em>pre-subimt</em> stage.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-stages"><a class="header" href="#workflow-stages">Workflow Stages</a></h2>
<p>A workflow goes through a lifecycle of stages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Submit</strong> - a workflow that has been started, but the submitter has not yet submitted it for review.  The submitter can return to the workflow at anytime (they will need the link to it), but no one else can access it.</li>
<li><strong>Submitted</strong> - as soon as the workflow is submitted, it will transition from “submitted” state immediately to “Pending”.  This is just an intermediate step that used internally.</li>
<li><strong>Pending</strong> - When a workflow is in the pending state, it’s being reviewed.  Depending on how many steps of approval has been defined, many interactions can happen while in the pending state.  Each time an approver passes the workflow to the next approval, the flow is still pending.  If an approver request revision, and it goes <em>back to a previous reviewer</em> - it’s against till pending.</li>
<li><strong>Returned</strong> - When an approver requests a revision, and there is no previous approver, the flow goes back to the submitter.  The submitter can edit their submission data, and resubmit.</li>
<li><strong>Rejected</strong> - Any approver can reject the workflow.  This terminates the lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Cancelled</strong> - A submitter can cancel their submission whenever it is in their hands.  This means they can cancel the submission if it is in the <em>pre-submit</em> or <em>returned</em> state.  A user cannot cancel a submission while it is being reviewed by an approver.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> - The final approver may complete the flow by approving.  This terminates the workflow’s lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can visualize the lifecycle as follows:</p>
<img src='../images/flow-lifecycle.png'/>
<p>All workflows are archived, and can be searched by any appiversity <strong>user</strong>.  Submitters can find their own workflows through the archive, and approvers can do the same.  The only workflows that are <em>not</em> archived are flows that are cancelled before any approver acts on the workflow.</p>
<p><a href="workflow/./workflow-notifications.html">Notifications</a> are triggered on every state change, and every time a workflow is moved into another person’s queue.</p>
<h2 id="submission-data"><a class="header" href="#submission-data">Submission Data</a></h2>
<p>Before moving forward, the user will be required to enter all required submission fields, which were defined when the workflow was created.  All of the input fields are found under the “Start Here” section.</p>
<img src='../images/flow-submit-fields.png'/>
<h2 id="uploading-submission-documents"><a class="header" href="#uploading-submission-documents">Uploading submission documents</a></h2>
<p>If the workflow has defined documents for submission, these will be displayed in the submission area.  Required documents block submission until they are uploaded.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/workflow-submit-file-upload.png'/>
<p>Note that if a document was provided as part of the workflow, for example <strong>a legacy form</strong>, it will be available via a link to download.  Here’s an example:</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/workflow-submit-file-download-upload.png'/>
<p>In this case, the “Course Prerequisite Form.pdf” document presumably is your institution’s fillable PDF for instructors to request a course prerequisite to be changed in the catalog.  The <strong>submitter</strong> would download it, by clicking the link.  The submitter then fills out the form, and <strong>uploads it</strong> as part of the submission.  This allows you to quickly leverage existing forms within Workflows.</p>

<p>When you are the submitter of a workflow, you’ll have full visibility into who is taking what actions on it from that point on.  Check out the following guide topics to learn more:</p>

<p>When you cannot approve the workflow, but you feel that the information submitted can be corrected, you can choose <strong>Request Revision</strong>.</p>
<img style='width:600px' src='../images/workflow-revision-resubmit.png'/>
<p>If you are the first approver, as is the case in the screenshot above, the workflow will return to the <em>submitter</em>.  If you are further down the approval chain, a request for revision will send the workflow back to whoever last approved it.  In both cases, the intended recipient will receive a <a href="workflow/./workflow-notifications.html">notification</a>, and your revision <strong>notes</strong> will be visible to that person.  If it is the last approver, they can elect to similarly pass the workflow <strong>back down the chain</strong>, all the way back to the submitter, but requesting another revision.</p>
<p>In the screenshot below, you can see what the <em>submitter</em> will see when their workflow is returned.  The status is clearly marked as <strong>RETURNED</strong>, and the reason is listed in the <strong>Previous Steps</strong> area of the workflow.</p>

<p>There are times where a workflow might arrive in your queue, but you aren’t the best person to review the submission.  This could happen for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are away, and someone is covering for you.</li>
<li>The submitter (or previous approver) made an error identifying you as the next recipient.</li>
<li>You are sharing duties with a colleague, and they are handling the approval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of why, you can <em>always</em> pass off the workflow to someone else.  Just scroll down to the <strong>Pass to another person</strong> area of the workflow, select the person you are looking for, and click <strong>Handoff to Selected Person</strong>.</p>

<p>There’s always an audit trail - so the handoff will be listed in the actions taken on this workflow.</p>
