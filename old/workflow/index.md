Workflows can replace the paper forms, Word documents, and PDF files that you are circulating via email to drive **approvals** and **workflow**.

Here's the scenario to think about:
- A student wants to drop a course.
- The student needs to fill out a form, and get their instructor's signatures.
- From there, they may need to have that form forwarded to the department chair or dean for another round of approval.
- Lastly, the form is forwarded to the registrar, where the request is processed.

This scenario get's repeated within academics countless times - from student requests, faculty travel requests, course scheduling modifications, graduation applications, etc.  

Ten or fifteen years ago, most institutions did this with *paper* forms, where each person along the approval chain needed to sign the document.  There's a certain convenience to this - there's just one copy of the form, and it's easy to fill out.  It's wasteful, and expensive though - and forms get lost.  

Then we all started *digitizing*, and it went something like this:
- Paper documents were converted into PDFs, but they were really difficult to "sign".  People printed them, filled them out, signed them, scanned them, and emailed them.  This didn't help much!  
- PDFs were then made "fillable", which helped, since now at least the form data didn't need to to be handwritten anymore!
- PDFs could be digitally signed - either by drawing a signature, attaching a photo of a drawn signature, or using a *digital signature* that needed to be created and configured on the user's computer.  This seemed right - but of course getting the signatures to reliably work, on everyone's computer, was a nightmare.

Ultimately, we replaced wasteful paper forms with *thousands* of email attachments, IT headaches configuring digital signatures (which really aren't necessary - these aren't exactly legal documents!), and aggravation.  

After all that, those digital documents remain in *everyone's* email archives - there's no repository for them.  There's no **real** paper trail at all!

Some institutions, recognizing the inefficiencies, adopted tools from the legal and real estate industry, which managed the digital signing of documents across approval chains without installation and email forwarding - *but they are expensive*.

<span style='color:OrangeRed'>Workflows </span> offers an alternative.  With workflows, you can easily create your forms and publish them in a searchable listing.  Users can fill forms, and get data prepopulated - which drastically improves accuracy.  You can create approval chains, and the form is instantaneously routed to where it needs to go.  Every step along the way, there is a full audit of who's approving, and when.  All stakeholders can see the status of the approval and workflow.  When the workflow is complete, it's archived and searchable from one place - by everyone.  

Finally, *workflows is free* (although long term retention is limited to paid plans).  It's included in the **Kickstart** package.
