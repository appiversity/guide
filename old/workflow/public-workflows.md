This document is a user guide for starting an existing **public** workflow.  It describes the sequence of steps a user will perform to start a workflow when they do not have an appiversity account.  This is the situation where you've [published a workflow](./publishing-workflows.md) and the form is to be started by students or anyone not affiliated with your institution.

Restricted workflows, which require appiversity login, are [discussed here](./starting-workflow.md).
