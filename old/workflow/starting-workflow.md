This document is a user guide for starting an existing workflow.  It describes the sequence of steps a user will perform to start a workflow **when they are already logged into appiversity**.  For public workflows - to be started by students or anyone not affiliated with your institution (they do not have an appiversity account), the process will be similar, but you should review the [public workflows guide](./public-workflows.html) instead.
