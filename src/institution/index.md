# Creating an institution
Every appiversity account is connected to an institution of higher education. To get started, enter your email address with a .edu domain. We'll check to see if your institution is already part of appiversity, and get you moving in the right direction either way.

In this section, we'll cover
- [Accessing demo institutions before you start](./demo.md) - you can try a lot of appiversity  without signing up at all!
- [Signing up for a new account in minutes](./signup.md) - get started with your kickstart account!
- [Verification](./verification.md) - the verification process makes sure only people authorized to make things public for your institution can do so!
