# Signing up
You can create an account in under 2 minutes.  No sales pitch, required demo, or implementation.  We are **always** here to help you learn, and will **always** help you build your data - but we pride ourselves on appiversity easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to leverage.

## Creating an account
When you start, you'll be on the *kickstart* plan, which give you full and complete access to Departments and Workflow, and most of our Catalog features.

[Creating an account](https://appiversity.com/account/signup) first asks you for an email address with a *.edu* ending.  This will be the email address you use for appiversity.  One of three things happens after this:

- **IF you are the first person from your .edu institution to sign up:**
*Then* your account is created right away.  We ask you for your name, and some simple information about your institution (it's name, address).  You'll create a new password, and off you go!


- **IF someone has already created an account with your .edu institution**:
*Here's where the [verification](./verification.md) processes is important*.  Anyone can create an account, so if the other account with your institution hasn't been verified, you will be given the option to simple create another one.  We collect all the same information from you, and you are ready to go.  Unverified accounts have a limited number of users, and can't make anything public - so while it doesn't make sense to have multiple accounts for your institution, we won't prevent you from doing so.  Sometimes people create accounts to try things out, and then later someone else does the same thing - no problem.

*If there's already a verified account* for the .edu institution you entered, then you will be asked to contact the account holder.  Only one account can exist for a verified institution.

Creating an account will require you to prove you own the email address you have provided.  Before moving forward, you'll need to enter the **activation** code we send to the provided email address.

Once you sign up, you'll be given a few *optional* next steps - which includes
- [Verification](./verification.md) - a free process which verifies you can speak for the institution, and unlocks all the features of the kickstart plan for your account.  This process also prevents any more accounts being from being created for your institution.
- [Creating some default roles](../departments/roles-positions-assignments.md) - most institution have some common roles (ie faculty), you'll be able to create them in one click to get started quickly.
- [Guide](https://guide.appiversity.com) pointers to help get  you moving.
