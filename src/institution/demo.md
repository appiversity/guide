# Before you sign up
If you are interested in what appiversity can help you with, you can check out the [demo accounts](https://appiversity.com/demo) before you sign up.  Demo accounts for [Barnett College](https://appiversity.com/demo/barnett), [Winston University](https://appiversity.com/demo/winston) and [Pembroke University](https://appiversity.com/demo) are setup with lots of data that you can access.

Demo accounts have:
- People / Departments 
- Roles / Positions / Assignments
- Academic degrees, programs, attainments, and courses
- Public and internal workflows

For the most part, demo accounts won't let you create, edit, or delete any data, but they give you a good idea of what appiversity looks like when you have an account.  There are in-app guides and hints to get you familiar with the application.

There are few areas where, if you enter your email address, you *can* create some data - particularly by accessing some of the *public workflows*.

If you are looking to just get an idea of what we do, the demo account logins are the perfect way to start.

## Get the full demo!
If you want to see **everyting** in action, reach out to use on the [demo page](https://appiversity.com/demo).  Just provide your contact information and we will get back to you right away to schedule a 30min video call, where we can show you all the features - including things not available on the public demo accounts, like full editing, Reqit catalog requirements entries, and more.

Your demo will be tailored to your institution, so please let us know what you are most interested in!

## Signing up is easy
Finally, signing up is easy, and risk free.  Our KickStart package is **free**, and **free forever**.  You can sign up with your **.edu** email address and get started in under **two minutes**.  No sales pitch - just jump right in!

Once you sign up and create an account, you can get to work.  When you are ready, you can get your [account verified](./verification.md) (*for free*) so we know you represent your institution - and you can start publishing publically - department and people listings, catalogs, public workflows, and more.
