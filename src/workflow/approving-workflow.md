## Requesting a Revision
When you cannot approve the workflow, but you feel that the information submitted can be corrected, you can choose **Request Revision**.

If you are the first approver, as is the case in the screenshot above, the workflow will return to the *submitter*.  If you are further down the approval chain, a request for revision will send the workflow back to whoever last approved it.  In both cases, the intended recipient will receive a [notification](./workflow-notifications.md), and your revision **notes** will be visible to that person.  If it is the last approver, they can elect to similarly pass the workflow **back down the chain**, all the way back to the submitter, but requesting another revision.

In the screenshot below, you can see what the *submitter* will see when their workflow is returned.  The status is clearly marked as **RETURNED**, and the reason is listed in the **Previous Steps** area of the workflow.

## Passing a Workflow to someone else
There are times where a workflow might arrive in your queue, but you aren't the best person to review the submission.  This could happen for many reasons:

- You are away, and someone is covering for you.
- The submitter (or previous approver) made an error identifying you as the next recipient.
- You are sharing duties with a colleague, and they are handling the approval.

Regardless of why, you can *always* pass off the workflow to someone else.  Just scroll down to the **Pass to another person** area of the workflow, select the person you are looking for, and click **Handoff to Selected Person**.

There's always an audit trail - so the handoff will be listed in the actions taken on this workflow.
