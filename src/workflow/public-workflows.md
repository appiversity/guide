This document is a user guide for starting an existing **public** workflow.  It describes the sequence of steps a user will perform to start a workflow when they do not have an appiversity account.  This is the situation where you've [published a workflow](./publishing-workflows.md) and the form is to be started by students or anyone not affiliated with your institution.

Restricted workflows, which require appiversity login, are [discussed here](./starting-workflow.md).




## Public Listings and Active Academic Year
Unlike most things in appiversity, workflows are *frequently* accessed by people who are not logged into the application.  When non-logged in people access workflows, they are typically accessing them via [published HTML listings pages](./publishing-workflows.md), or from links they have saved (for example, in an email).  

Workflows can only be **initiated** or **started** if they belong to the current academic year.  Checkout the workflows section in our [active AY](../academic-years/active-ay.md) guide for more details.
