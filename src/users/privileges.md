# Privileges
KE Users can be given fine-grain control over the portions of the application they can access.  In general, limited account users can *view* most data on appiversity:

## Access for Limited Users
- *Departments* - All limited users (public, student, faculty/staff) can search and view listings of departments, people, positions, and roles.
- *Workflows* - All limited users can start workflows, and interact with workflows they are the next action person on.
- *Catalog* - All limited users can search courses and academic programs, view course and program details, including prerequisites and curricular maps.  Limited users **cannot** directly view degrees, course attributes, attainments, or Reqit code - however they will see things that are actually associated with courses and degrees.  For example, a course's attributes will be visible when viewing the course, but the limited user cannot access the complete list of course attributes themselves.
- *Scheduler* - All limited users can view lists of timeblocks and classrooms, and can view a readonly version of schedules both in the past and current.  All public details about a section - including instructor, seats available, classroom, time, day are viewable.
- *Registration* - Limited users are constrained to view/access only what their role entails.  Students may register for courses.  Faculty and other staff members can access registration overrides.
- *Student Services* - Students have full view of their transcripts, tutoring schedules, and all other information available.  Faculty and staff have access to associated student data in a read-only manner.
