## Custom Solutions for Institutions
In addition to our standard support services, we offer custom solutions for institutions through separately contracted agreements. These custom solutions may include:
- **Integrations** with existing institutional systems.
- **Custom features** for private hosting accounts.
- **Additional dedicated servers** for enhanced performance and scalability.

These services are available as part of tailored agreements with institutions. However, please note that regardless of whether your institution opts for custom solutions, our standard support remains free for all users.
