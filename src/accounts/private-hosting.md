# Private Hosting
*Effective Date: February, 2025*  

## Overview
For institutions that require dedicated resources, we offer private hosting plans. These plans provide a fully isolated hosting environment tailored to the needs of each institution while maintaining the reliability and support of our cloud-based platform.

## Custom Domain and IT Collaboration
Private hosting plans are hosted on appiversity’s secure infrastructure but are configured with a domain name associated with your institution, such as `appiversity.your-college.edu`. Our team will work closely with your institution’s IT department to establish the necessary DNS and routing records to ensure seamless integration with your existing systems.

## Dedicated and Isolated Infrastructure
Unlike our standard multi-tenant environment, private hosting ensures that all of your institution’s data is stored in an entirely separate and isolated database. This means:
- Your database is completely independent, with no cross-tenant data exposure.
- You have direct access to your database, allowing for advanced query management and custom analytics.
- Dedicated application servers run your instance of the application, ensuring that performance is unaffected by other institutions.

## Performance and Resource Allocation
With private hosting, your institution benefits from dedicated resources:
- **Web Traffic Isolation**: Your web traffic remains exclusive to your institution’s users, ensuring consistent performance.
- **Dedicated CPU and Memory**: Your application runs on a dedicated set of hardware, eliminating resource contention from other institutions.
- **Disk Space Management**: Storage resources are allocated based on your institution’s needs, preventing unexpected slowdowns due to shared disk usage.

## Security and Compliance
Private hosting enhances security measures beyond our multi-tenant setup:
- **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel within your institution will have access to your database and server resources.
- **Regular Security Audits**: We perform ongoing security checks to ensure compliance with industry best practices.

## Pricing and Contract Terms
Private hosting is available with a one-time setup fee and an annual contract. Pricing is determined based on your institution’s expected usage, including:
- Database size and storage requirements.
- Expected web traffic and application load.
- Custom integration or additional support needs.
