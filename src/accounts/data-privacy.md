# Data Privacy
*Effective Date: July, 2024*  

We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains how we handle your data when you use our multi-tenant cloud application. Our goal is to protect your information while providing a secure and reliable service.

## Data Ownership
You own your data. As an account holder, any academic data you store within our application remains your property. We do not claim ownership, nor do we sell, share, or monetize your data in any way.

## How We Store Your Data
Our application operates in a multi-tenant environment, which means your data is stored in a shared database along with data from other account holders. However, strict security measures ensure that you can only access your own data. Each account is securely isolated using access controls and encryption.

If you require a dedicated database for additional security and compliance, we offer private hosting plans. Contact us for more details.

## Data Security
We implement industry-standard security practices to safeguard your data, including:
- Encryption in transit and at rest.
- Role-based access controls to restrict unauthorized access.
- Regular security audits and updates.

## Data Access and Control 
You can access, modify, or delete your data at any time using your account controls. If you need assistance or wish to close your account, contact our support team.

## Third-Party Access 
We do not sell or share your data with third parties. However, we may use trusted third-party service providers for infrastructure and security purposes. These providers are contractually bound to maintain data confidentiality and security.

## Compliance and Legal Requirements  
We comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations. If required by law, we may disclose your data to authorities, but only after verifying the legal request.

## Changes to This Policy  
We may update this policy to reflect improvements in security and compliance. If changes are made, we will notify account holders in advance.
