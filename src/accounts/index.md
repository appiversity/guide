# Account Management
This section provides important information about managing your appiversity account, including account upgrades, the role of the Representative of Record, data privacy, private hosting options, and support services.

## Account Management  
You have full control over your account, including the ability to upgrade, suspend, or delete it. Paid plans include options for account suspension and reactivation within a set retention period.  See [Upgrading](./upgrading.md) and [Cancellation/Suspension](./cancel.md).

## Representative of Record
Each institution must designate a [Representative of Record](./ror.md), who is responsible for account validation, billing communications, and managing institutional data. This individual is verified by Appiversity and can appoint additional representatives as needed.

## Data Privacy
We prioritize the security of your data. Account holders own their data, and we do not sell or share it. Our multi-tenant cloud application ensures strict access controls, with private hosting options available for additional data isolation.  See more in our [Data Privacy Policy](./data-privacy.md)

## Private Hosting
For institutions requiring dedicated infrastructure, private hosting provides an isolated environment with dedicated servers and databases. This ensures exclusive resource allocation and enhanced security. You can learn more [here](./private-hosting.md)

## Support 
All account holders, whether on free or paid plans, receive full support from our team. There are no chatbotsâ€”only live support professionals available to assist you. Custom solutions and integrations for institutions are available under separate agreements, but standard support remains free for all users.  Learn more [here](./support.md)
