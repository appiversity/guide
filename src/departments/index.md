# People & Departments
- Using spreadsheets and files to keep track of who's in each department, committee, and program? Are a bunch of other offices doing the same thing? Are the lists manually maintained in a dozen digital systems... separately?

- When someone needs information, where do they go? How do they get a report?

- Can you give someone access without them being able to make changes?

- Whenever something does change, how many spreadsheets need to get updated? Can you tell who made the changes, and what they were? Who can change the data in this database, or that? Is the college website updated? 

Departments is a centralized, interactive, and searchable registry of everyone in your institution. It tracks which s and groups they belong to, and what roles they play.

Departments lets you embed these lists on your institution's web page, and integrate data into your other systems. Everyone sees live data.

Departments also lets you manage multiple years, so anyone can access listings from different years. It lets you manage people and their roles just like you manage course catalogs - with full archives of past years.

You can control who has access to what, and always have an audit trail of changes.

It's a single source of truth for who's who on campus.

## Your Data
You are never locked in. Department data is always exportable in easy to use formats, and always ready to be integrated. You can organize your department and group structures any way you like. 

## Use everywhere 
Department's killer feature is integration. You can manage s, people, positions and roles in one place - but the data can flow everywhere. Easily embed live views on web pages. Export as documents / spreadsheets / PDFs. Share links to live reports. Integrate with other systems with industry standard JSON, CSV, Webhooks, and a complete API.

No complex set up. No complicated training. No ugly and awkward user experience or workarounds. It just works.
