# Differences between People, Public People, and Users
There are four different kinds of user accounts on appiversity, and understanding the differences are important moving forward in this guide.


| Type |  Description | Login Type |
|------|--------------|------------|
| User |  User accounts are for people who will be **creating** content on appiversity.  These are the people who enter catalog data, define top level data like terms, grade types, academic year rollovers.  They can create departments, people, degrees, programs, etc.  Most people in your institution **will not** have User accounts.|[Password](../signin/password.md) and [OTL Token](../signin/otl.md)|
| People (Person) | This is the most common type of account for a staff member or faculty member to have.  At a minimum, this means they are listed in the People section of appiversity.  They will have a publishable profile page, and can be assigned positions at the institution (ie Department Chair).  Based on their role, they will have access to *use* many parts of appiversity.  For example, all **People** can access Workflows to *start* workflows.  People with faculty roles will likely have some access to schedule builder.   | [OTL Token](../signin/otl.md) |
| Student[^student] | Student accounts have access to their own student records, along with access to registration/scheduling services (*for accounts with Registration and Records*).  Students typically access data through public (published) resources, but do have the ability to browse the Catalog, search People and Department listings, and can (if they choose) access Workflows from within appiversity.|[OTL Token](../signin/otl.md)|
| Public Person | Public people are unaffiliated with the institution.  They do not have a university/college email address.  In most cases, a Public Person account is created by the individual in order to fill out a Workflow that is marked as public.  appiversity does not use Public Person accounts for any purpose other than verifying email addresses.  The person will be asked to enter their email address, and they will be sent a verification email to activate their account.  From that point forward, each time they initiate an action on any public-facing appiversity feature, they will receive a **one-time-token**, sent to their email address, to verify their identity. | [OTL Token](../signin/otl.md) |

[^student]: For accounts that are using Registration and Records, students have limited accounts, and can access their own workflow queue through appiversity.  Otherwise, students utilize the public person login and feature access flow.
