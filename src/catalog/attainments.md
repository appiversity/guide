# Attainments
Every**thing** in catalog *is* an attainment.  Degrees, programs, courses - they are all things that students complete.  There are some requirements that don't fit into the *course* bucket though.  Examples:

- Minimum graduation GPA
- Minimum number of credits
- Tuition bill paid
- Placement testing scores

Your institution might have many more.  For all of the *requirement* that aren't course completions, or sets of course completions, we have generic **attainments**.  You can create attainments if you have the *catalog* privilege.  Attainments have a name, description, and a type - Yes/No, quantity ( a number) , or Test Score.  We can easily create more types for your account if you need them - just ask!  In most cases though, these types cover the use cases institutions use generic attributes for.

Attainments can be directly referenced in [Reqit](/reqit/) requirement expressions.
