# Catalog
The appiversity Catalog module is a powerful tool designed to help institutions manage and publish their academic offerings. It allows you to model full academic degrees, programs (such as majors, minors, and general education sequences), courses, and their associated requirements. With an intuitive interface, the catalog is fully searchable, easy to navigate, and simple to publish, ensuring that students, faculty, and administrators can access up-to-date academic information effortlessly.


## Comprehensive Curriculum Modeling
The catalog enables institutions to model every aspect of their curriculum, including:
- **[Degree, Programs and how to model them](/catalog/degrees-programs.md):** Define complete academic programs with clear requirements.
- **[Courses and Requirements](/catalog/courses.md):** Specify individual courses, their prerequisites, and co-requisites.
- **[Course Attributes](/catalog/course-attributes.md):** Assign attributes such as "Lab," "Writing Intensive," or "Capstone."
- **[Other Attainments](/catalog/attainments.md):** Track standardized test scores, placement scores, career service seminar attendance, or any other non-course requirement.

### Seamless Navigation and Search
TheCatalog is designed with usability in mind. Users can:
- Quickly search for courses, programs, and requirements.
- Easily browse through categories and attributes.
- View detailed requirement structures without digging through complex documents.

### Easy Publishing and Updates
Academic institutions frequently update courses, and the Catalog makes it simple to keep information current. Faculty and administrators can make changes without needing extensive technical knowledge, ensuring that students always have access to the most up-to-date program and course requirements.

## Defining Requirements with Reqit
One of the most powerful features of the Catalog is [Reqit](../reqit/index.md), a specialized language for defining academic requirements. Instead of manually specifying each individual course in a program or prerequisite structure, Reqit allows for high-level, flexible rule definitions.

### The Benefits of Reqit
- **Dynamic Updates:** Requirements do not need to be edited every time a new course is added or removed.
- **Simplified Rule Creation:** Instead of listing every possible course manually, you can define broad conditions like "any 200-level Math course" or "at least two Data Science electives."
- **Clear Structure:** Reqit ensures that requirements are unambiguous and machine-readable, making it easier for students and advisors to interpret program requirements.

By leveraging Reqit within the appiversity Catalog, institutions can streamline curriculum management, improve clarity in academic advising, and maintain flexibility in program structures over time.
