# Importing, Exporting, and Publishing
One of the most important features of **appiversity** is its seamless ability to integrate with other applications. Whether you need to bring data into the system or share it with other platforms, **aappiversity** makes it simple. Our import and export functionality supports a variety of formats, ensuring you can work with your data in the way that best suits your needs.

We understand that working with data across different systems should not be difficult. That's why **appiversity** supports easy imports and exports in multiple formats, including CSV, JSON, and Excel, allowing you to transfer data with minimal effort. Whether you're integrating with third-party applications or managing data internally, we provide the flexibility you need to streamline your workflows.

In addition to our robust import/export features, we offer extensive support for integrations. For more information on how to integrate **appiversity** with your systems, check out our [Support Page](../accounts/support.md). We're here to help ensure your experience is as smooth as possible.

## Publishing Data
So much of the data you put into appiversity is meant to be **published**.  Exporting is one way to facilitate, but we have much easier ways for you to integrate your department, people, workflow, catalog, and other data into existing websites - and that's through *publishing*.  Check out the [publishing](./embedding.md) documentation to learn more.
